 Objectives:
- Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the model on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
- Make predictions on the test set.
- Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

 Key Activities:
1. Data Loading: Load the dataset using `pandas`.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and perform any necessary data cleaning.
3. Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training: Train a simple linear regression model on the training data.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
6. Predictions: Make predictions on the test set.
7. Visualization:
   - Plot the regression line.
   - Visualize actual vs. predicted values.

 Technologies Used:
- Python: The programming language used for the analysis and modeling.
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

 Key Insights:
1. Model Performance: The model's performance is evaluated using MSE and R², which indicate how well the model fits the data.
2. Regression Line: The regression line provides a visual representation of the relationship between the feature and the target variable.
3. Actual vs. Predicted Values: The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values helps in assessing the model's accuracy and identifying any systematic errors
